### Features

#### FPS in your hands.

Optimized based on Chocapic13's Shaders,

Removed some unnecessary features,

Some bugs have also been fixed,

Let you have an excellent FPS.

#### Crisp and bright picture.

Removed some features of Chocapic13's Shaders,

But it's not one-size-fits-all like some shaders,

Instead, it retains excellent picture manifestation:
- Water reflections
- Water surface ripples
- Good shadows
- Outstanding performance in different weather
- Clouds that move with the wind
- and more...

And added a few features of it own.

#### Exclusive Atmosphere.

Gives you a unique atmosphere.

#### Excellent field of view brightness.

Doesn't make you feel so dark in the Nether instead of you can't see anything like the usual shaders.
